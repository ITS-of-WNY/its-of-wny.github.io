ITS.com
==============

getting started:

`gem install jekyll`
`jekyll serve`


Posts filenames need to be in the format:
`_posts/yyyy-mm-dd-url-friendly-title.md`


with the overhead thing:
```
---
layout: post
title: "My Second Post"
published: 1
---

Lorem ipsum...
```


✓ adjust hero image sizing
✓ hide mini ITS when nav is not stuck
- splash should use bigger version of logo
- address the address on the header
✓ `Careers` -> `Employment opportunities`


- More color for Areas page

- Perhaps the black lettering on the first page could be changed to blue to match the color of the blocks on our letterhead.  Then have the blue blocks and the tagline blue as well................

* ask how many posts they want shown on the page at once
- would a link to an archive of the posts be useful? e.g. 'view old news' link would list everything. could also filter out certain posts so only event posts are 'saved', etc
