      </header>
      <p><span class="image left"><img src="/assets/images/pic09.jpg" alt=""></span>ITS was established in 1996 as an agency providing early intervention services in Genesee and Wyoming counties. Additional counties were added and our agency expanded to include 3-5 services and school contracts at the request of counties and districts as they looked for alternatives to their current situations.</p>
      <div class="box">
        <p>ITS was reorganized in 2011 as ITS of WNY, OT/PT/SLP, PLLC. We currently have 53 employees on staff.</p>
