ITS.com
==============

getting started:

`gem install jekyll`
`jekyll serve`


Posts filenames need to be in the format:
`_posts/yyyy-mm-dd-url-friendly-title.md`


with the overhead thing:
```
---
layout: post
title: "My Second Post"
---

Lorem ipsum...
```



Need:

- Photos of staff, offices, whatever
- little bit more for the history blurb (talk on phone)
- should fax be listed?
- what's the age range? email said birth to 21, another said birth to 2, one of your services is offered to 3-5, ....
- need calendar of events (just the weekly schedule is fine too)
- hours of operation



✓ change upcoming events link to 'about its'
- fax
✓ info+jobs@integratedtherapy.org
- back to top button on services


- adjust hero image sizing
- hide mini ITS when nav is not stuck
- splash should use bigger version of logo
- address the address on the header (haha)
- `Careers` -> `Employment opportunities`

* ask how many posts they want shown on the page at once

- More color for Areas page

- Perhaps the black lettering on the first page could be changed to blue to match the color of the blocks on our letterhead.  Then have the blue blocks and the tagline blue as well................
