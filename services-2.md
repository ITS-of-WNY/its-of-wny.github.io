          <p>We are contracted with the NYS Dept of Health to provide birth-2 services in Erie, Gen., Orleans and Wyoming Counties. This program is designed to meet the needs of families and their children who demonstrate developmental delays or who are diagnosed with a condition with a high probability of developmental delay. Referrals come from parents, caregivers, and the medical community through the health departments and youth bureaus in the counties in which the child resides.</p>

          <p>Early intervention services that ITS of WNY provide include multi-disciplinary evaluations and direct therapy which may include speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy as well as special instruction by certified special education teachers. The agency also offers services by a teacher of the deaf and a teacher of the visually impaired if a child presents with vision or hearing difficulties.</p>

          <p>Services primarily take place in a child's home, daycare center, or a caregiver's home, at the direction of the child's family.</p>
